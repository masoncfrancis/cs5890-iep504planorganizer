# CS 5890 - Final Project

## Credit

I based my project initially off of code available [here](https://github.com/sunilkumardash9/Pdf-GPT) in 
order to have a web interface and be able to ingest PDFs into the LLM. Information about the licensing
terms used is available in [opensource.md](opensource.md).

I also used ChatGPT in making changes to and understanding the GUI in Gradio. I used OpenAI's API documentation
to integrate GPT-4 into this project.
